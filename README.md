This application is created for University of Helsinki Data Structure Lab course.

### Project at this point

Project can be run at least in NetBeans, and it has a user interface. It has one ciphering algorithm
and it supports letters and some special characters. If you don't use "'" you can write normal letters
which you can encrypt and decrypt. You can try it for example with a sentence like "This message will
be encrypted and decrypted successfully."
