# Week report 1

### Done on this week

This week I attended the starting lecture and spent time mostly on deciding the subject for this
project. I was pondering between file compressing and crypting and decided to try crypting as it 
seemed more interesting to me. After that I started reading about different types of ciphering algorithms
and found at least three different level of the I'd like to try. This week I also wrote down project
specification, inited Gradle project and iniated git repository. With those I also started to plan some
of the structure on the application and features. Also I tried to figure out how I could implement these
algorithms to a programming language. Planning has not been documented yet, but it is shaping little by
little in my thoughts. 

### Progress

As mentioned, project folder and Github repo have been initiated and possible algorithms have been taken
in consideration. Documentation has been started and repo has been pushed to Github. 

### What have been learned

I have learned a bit about different ciphering methods and that will probably continue through the course.

### Problems

Mostly my problem at this point is that I'm not sure if these algorithms are complex enough for this 
course, that is my own issue as I didn't ask from instructors in time. Also I'd like to try some really
complex encrypting but I'm not sure if I have the time or understanding to complete something like
blowfish during this course. 

### What's next?

If needed, I'll find some more algorithms for this project, or if I'll find something that I feel like
implementing I'll look into it. Probably next step for me is to start working on the GUI and the 
program logic itself, maybe implementing simplest of the algorithms to the application.

### Time spent this week

This week I spent around 6h on the project.
