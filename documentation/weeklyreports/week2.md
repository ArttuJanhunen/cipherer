# Week report 2

### Done on this week

This week I have been working on the UI and on the first encryption method. UI has been created and it
is looking suprisingly good. There is not too much to be implemented to it to ensure proper usage of
the application, ciphering algorithm choosing is something that is missing. JavaDocs have been written
to existing classes.

### Progress

UI has progressed quite much, and the first algorithm has been done. First tests have been written and 
checkstyle has been initialised too. JavaDocs have been started.  

### What have been learned

This week has been mostly about learning new. UI is made with swing library that I haven√§t used before.
I also continued reading about new algorithms to implement, as in feedback it was told that most any of
the planned algorithms are not suitable for this course. I'm thinking of using knapsack ciphering and
RSA-ciphering in this project.

### Problems

Problems have occurred. Tests won't run and I couldn't figure out why, even though I tried to follow 
instructions. I could use some guidance on those. Gradle doesn't find the tests created in the test file
and sometimes it gives error that some launcher is missing. On GUI I tried first to use gradle project
with javaFX but that failed as my java version won't support it, I tried also maven project to avoid
that issue. But swing works fine, I'll stick to that. Also these problems took me time to solve, so it
made it a bit tight squeeze to start working on proper ciphering methods, so those will have to be
postponed to next week. Feedback was given couple of days before this deadline, so I felt also like there
wasn't enough time to react to the instructions about the algorithms. 

### What's next?

Next week I'll hopefully get the tests working and I'll continue on working with GUI and start to 
implement more complex algorithms. 

### Time spen this week

This week I spent around 15h on the project.
