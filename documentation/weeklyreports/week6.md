# Week report 6

### Done on this week

This week I did the second peer review, updated documentation and created performance testing for the
application.

### Progress

On schedule.

### What have been learned

Performance testing is quite heavy on the application and java does not react to changes as fast as 
React.

### Problems

Like last week, javaFX made reviewing quite dull. 

### What's next

Refactor GUI to multiple files as GUI file is getting really big and hard to read, make some try-catches
for ciphering, maybe still implement the file reading option. 

### Time spent this week

This week I spent around 7h on the project.
