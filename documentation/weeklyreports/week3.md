# Week report 3

### Done on this week

The tests are working! Figured out the reason for tests and builds not running with gradle, but now it
has changed so that running from netbeans won't work. I'm assuming that it has something to do with
netbeans configurations not being in line with gradle's. UI has been updated to support two different
ciphering methods and also result field has now a copy button, which makes it easier to copy the result.
I have written some more tests and connected the repository to CodeCov and to CircleCI. I implemented
a new ciphering method, knapsack cryptosystem and with that I created a new helper that can convert
text to binary code. New classes also have their JavaDocs written. 

### Progress

Progress has been good, those issues from the beginning have solved and things seem to be going rather
smoothly, for now. 

### What have been learned

I have learned some more debugging for issues in gradle, revised myself with pipelines and learned how
to convert text to binary and back. Also I have learned a new ciphering method. 


### Problems

As surprising it is, this time I don't think I was left with existing issues.

### What's next?

Next it is time for the main course: RSA.

### Time spent this week

This week I spent around 13h on the project.
