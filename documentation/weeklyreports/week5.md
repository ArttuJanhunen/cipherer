# Week report 5

### Done on this week

This week I didn't put so much work in to this course, as most of the goals were the same as last week.
But still, this week I did the peer review, started to study more about the performance testing and 
updated documentation quite a bit. 

### Progress

Documentation is shaping up quite nicely.

### What have been learned

Working part-time and doing three courses can be a bit tiring when autumn falls and daytime is getting
shorter. 

### Problems

Doing peer review was a bit dull as my java versions did not match with the ones that I was reviewing.

### What's next?

Implement a proper performance testing sequences to the application and keep in mind that .txt-file
possibility as thought last week. 


### Time spent this week

This week I spent around 6h on the project.
