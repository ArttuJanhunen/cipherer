# Week report 4

### Done on this week

This week I created the RSA ciphering and implemented it to the GUI. This includes writing the code,
tests and JavaDocs. Also made available to the user the time it takes for a certain method to encrypt
or decrypt a message. I guess this passes as a performance test?

### Progress

Looks to me like the core functions of the application are now completed and without java's own data
structures.

### What have been learned

RSA itself is not supposed to be implemented on letter ciphering. Took me a while but I got around it
by ciphering two letters as one element, so frequence analysis won't be so easy. Also learned how to
use BigIntegers, as the numbers grew so big that even java's Long couldn't handle them. 

### Problems

At this point there are no problems, maybe more of questions. What would be good to have in the implementation
documentation? And what would be a correct way to do the performance testing for the application?

### What's next?

Next things would be to update the documentation and see if there is something to improve in the 
application. Also the initial thought that you could encrypt and decrypt .txt-files could be implemented
if there's enough time. 

### TIme spent this week

This week I spent around 8h on the project.
