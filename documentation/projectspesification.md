# Project specification

### Degrees and languages

* Bachelor's degree in computer science
* Language for this project is english
* Programming language for this project is Java

### Problem to solve

Basically this isn't a problem that is being solved, but the idea for this project is to create a way
to encrypt and decrypt messages.

### Data structures

Structures in this project will be tables and two-dimensional matrixes, as ciphering is done on 
character level.

### Algorithms

Algorithms in use will be my own implementations for different ciphering styles, for example 
[Columnar transposition](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/coltrans.php) will be used in this project.

### Program inputs

Program will receive its input from user through a text field and then produce encryption on decryption
from that input. Another possibility would be to read from .txt files and produce wanted output from
there.

### Expected time complexities

TODO
