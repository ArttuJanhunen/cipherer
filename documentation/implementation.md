# Implementation

### GUI

User interface is graphical and created with java swing library. UI then proceeds to call core methods
to complete the desired actions.

### Input / Output

Input and output are both provided trough UI, and currently input is given via keyboard by the user.
Output is provided to the lower text field as encrypted or decrypted result for the given input.


### Logic

Programs functionality is based in the logic folder, which has the three ciphering methods inside it
along with the helper classes. 

### Class dependency flow
